Ask everyone to looks at their profiles in the seeds file...right now everyone is 24 but me.

Profiles need to be linked by email:
    create user1 then user2
    user2 creates profile
    log in as user1 view profile page and see user2 profile
    login as user2 view profile page and get new profile create instead

Can view other profiles by changing url.

Gender needs to be changed back to DB from profile edit page.

Try to apply style sizes using paperclip rather than css.

Add photos to Seed for each of us

Can we make positive notice messages green rather than red?

Notes:

I don't know why the stop button disappears from the run tab but ^F2 works to kill the server!
